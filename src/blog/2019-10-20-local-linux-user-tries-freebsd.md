I recently built a new desktop computer for myself, and decided to repurpose my old desktop computer to be [a pfSense router.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PfSense){ rel=nofollow } pfSense comes with a webserver that serves a configuration GUI accessible from any device on the LAN. The GUI also has a status dashboard that shows real-time hardware stats, service status, network utilization and firewall logs.

However I wanted to be able to access the status dashboard from the CLI, so that I could stuff it in a tmux session along with the dashboards for my other computers instead of running a whole browser instance just for it. So I set about figuring out how the web dashboard works behind the scenes and how I could replicate it to run as a CLI program over ssh.

Since pfSense is based on FreeBSD and I only had experience with Linux, it was a learning experience to find all the differences between the two - from minor differences in the parameters of well-known commands, to differences in philosophy.

The information that pfSense's web dashboard shows is itself pulled from shelling out to native commands or reading files:

- Version information via `/etc/version`, `/etc/version.path`, `/etc/version.buildtime` and `uname`
- Uptime via `sysctl kern.boottime`
- CPU usage via `sysctl kern.cp_time`
- Memory usage via `sysctl hw.physmem` and `sysctl vm.stats.vm.v_{inactive,cache,free}_count`
- Disk information via `sysctl kern.disks` and `df`
- Temperature sensor readings via `sysctl` with names depending on the hardware. For example, my Intel CPU's sensors are reported through `sysctl dev.cpu.{0,1,2,3}.temperature` and some additional sensors through `hw.acpi.thermal.tz{0,1}.temperature`
- Network interfaces status via `ifconfig` and `netstat`
- Services status (running or not running) via `pgrep`

Now that I knew what files and shell commands my dashboard would invoke, the next step was to decide what language I should implement it in.

The program would just be writing text to stdout, including escape sequences to clear the screen and scrollback. Since that is easy in most programming languages, my choice was largely dictated by what language runtimes and compiler packages I had available.

Rust was my first choice since it is what I've been using primarily for the last few years. However the current version of pfSense (2.4.4) is based on FreeBSD 11, and I couldn't find out definitive information whether Rust supports it. Specifically, FreeBSD 12 changed the ABI of some of its libc structures and Rust's standard library had updated to work with it, so I wasn't sure if a program compiled against Rust's `x86_64-unknown-freebsd` target would work on FreeBSD 11 or only on FreeBSD 12.

A bigger problem was figuring out how to actually use Rust. I didn't want to install Rust or a C toolchain on the router itself, and setting up a FreeBSD-cross-compiler toolchain on my Linux machine appeared to require that I compile the cross compiler from source. This was more effort than I was willing to put in.

C was my second choice, but again I didn't want to install a C toolchain on the router or set up a cross-compiler on my Linux machine.

I then tried shell, and hit two snags:

- The default FreeBSD shell (for the root user, as per [this HN user](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21567879){ rel=nofollow }) is `tcsh`. I *was* prepared to not have `bash`, but `tcsh` is quite alien in its syntax compared to regular POSIX `sh`. I decided to ignore it and just use POSIX `sh`.

- POSIX `sh` misses a few things I'd come to take for granted in `bash`.

    There is no process substition via `<()`, so it's not possible to have pipelined commands modify variables in the outer scope (such as if chomping a command output line-by-line with `| while read -r line; do ...`).

    Most importantly, POSIX `sh` does not have arrays, so I had to resort to constructing variables names with indices like `FOO_$i` using string concat, and using `eval` for all reads and writes to them.

I did manage to implement the dashboard in POSIX `sh`; however its CPU usage was quite high for my taste. This was mostly because almost all the commands I was shelling out to had to be further processed using `cut` or `grep` or `sed` or `awk`, so there were a lot of processes being created and lots of strings being sliced and diced every time the dashboard refreshed.

I initially set about replacing some of the `cut`s and `grep`s and `sed`s with `awk`. But then I realized I could just as well write the whole dashboard as a single AWK script and not bother with POSIX `sh` at all.

The result is at [pfsense-dashboard-cli](https://github.com/Arnavion/pfsense-dashboard-cli){ rel=nofollow } and I'm quite satisfied with it.

It does have a dependency on `perl` to get the current time in seconds from the Unix epoch. This is because FreeBSD's `date` does not have a way to get milliseconds in the time, which is important for refreshing the dashboard once every second, which in turn is important for getting accurate network usage numbers (`(current bytes - previous bytes) / (current iteration time - previous iteration time)`; losing milliseconds in the denominator can introduce large errors in the result).

&lt;update&gt; Users on HN pointed out [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21567675){ rel=nofollow } and [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21568087){ rel=nofollow } that `perl` is not part of a base FreeBSD install. But it *does* appear to be part of a default pfSense install, so it doesn't violate my "don't manually install any additional packages" constraint. &lt;/update&gt;

<h2 id="what-did-i-learn">[What did I learn?](#what-did-i-learn)</h2>

The list of files and commands above shows some major differences between Linux and FreeBSD. A Linux program would get uptime from `/proc/uptime`, read temperature sensors from files under `/sys/class/hwmon`, and get CPU, memory and network stats from procfs and sysfs. Most of these interfaces are exposed as raw numbers and can be easily manipulated from shell or with `bc`.

In contrast, a lot of the equivalent information in FreeBSD is obtained through `sysctl` or shell commands intended for human consumption. In fact, FreeBSD does not have procfs or sysfs at all. (Apparently a simplified procfs is available for you to mount at `/proc` yourself if you want it. I did not try it, because it wouldn't have had everything I need anyway.)

~~In some cases the `sysctl` output is not easily machine-parseable. For example, the uptime information from `sysctl -n kern.boottime` looks like~~

~~```
{ sec = 1570952543, usec = 411609 } Sun Oct 13 00:42:23 2019
```~~

~~... which is a strange amalgamation of a C-like structure and a formatted datetime string. While it looks easy enough to extract the first two numbers with a regex or naively splitting on spaces, an output like this makes you wonder if it's guaranteed to always be like that. For example, could it sometimes get emitted as `{ usec = ..., sec = ... } ...` instead? Compare with Linux's `/proc/uptime` - `601553.11 14266486.38` - it can be easily split on the space and needs no additional parsing.~~

~~Similarly, the temperature sensor values on Linux from files under `/sys/class/hwmon` are usually just numbers in milli-degrees Celsius. For example, `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input` might be `32750` representing 32.750 degrees Celsius. However the FreeBSD `sysctl` values look like `30.0C`, so they first need string processing to strip the `C` suffix and get the raw value.~~

&lt;update&gt;

An HN user [pointed out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21567585){ rel=nofollow } that `sysctl -b kern.boottime` might be a better option. Indeed, it writes 16 bytes, where the first eight are the seconds and the latter eight the microseconds of the bootime, in little-endian. `awk` can't easily parse raw binary input, so the script passes it through `od -t uI` first.

Similarly, `sysctl -b dev.cpu.0.temperature` writes a four-byte unsigned integer that represents the temperature in deci-Kelvin. For example, a value of 3061 means the temperature is 306.1 K, or 33.0 Â°C.

So it doesn't matter if the output of `sysctl -n` is not ideal for machine consumption.

&lt;/update&gt;

And again, getting network stats on Linux can be done by reading `/sys/class/net/enp4s0/statistics/{r,t}x_bytes` which yield a single number each. FreeBSD's `netstat -I em0 -bin` returns a tabular display, so you have to skip the first line of table headers, then split each row on whitespace, then select the second-last or fifth-last values and add them manually. My NICs use the `igb` driver which does have sysctls similar to the Linux `{r,t}x_bytes` files, but these would only exist for the hardware interfaces and  not for logical interfaces like bridge networks.

&lt;update&gt;

The same HN user pointed out that `netstat` writes its output using libxo, and thus `netstat -I em0 -bin --libxo json` would write JSON output. This would be good, except that `awk` doesn't really have a way to handle this better than the original pretty-printed tabular output. The best I could come up with was to use `json,pretty` so that every key-value pair goes on its own line, and then slice the lines to extract the values, but this would not be an improvement.

Of course, this would not be a problem for a program that can parse JSON or XML.

pfSense also does not appear to have any simple `jq`-like utilities installed by default. It does have [`uclcmd`,](https://github.com/allanjude/uclcmd){ rel=nofollow } and I got as far as `netstat -I em0 -bin --libxo json | uclcmd get -f - -j '.statistics.interface'` to get an array of objects, but could get no further on account of `uclcmd`'s non-existent documentation. I would now need to apply a function like `["received-bytes"]` to each element of the array, and its Github readme hints at the existence of an `each` function, but any attempt to use it made the command segfault. I gave up on it.

&lt;/update&gt;

For what it's worth, some of these problems are solved by using C instead of shell. For example, the `gettimeofday` function does return the current time with milliseconds. Network stats can be obtained in strongly-typed fashion using `ioctl`, which is also how pfSense web dashboard gets them.

Apart from that, some of the FreeBSD commands are subtly different from their Linux counterparts. `pidof` doesn't exist and you have to use `pgrep -x` instead. `find -name foo` doesn't work and explicitly requires the starting directory, like `find . -name foo`, whereas it's implicitly the current directory in Linux. As mentioned above, `date` does not support `.%N` which on Linux outputs decimal seconds. And nothing recognizes `--help`, though that still means they print their helptext anyway, though their helptext is just a list of flags with no explanation and you have to read the manual to know what they do.

But that's enough complaining. Now for the good parts.

The BSDs are known for having good manuals, though pfSense does not include them so I had to look for them online. They are at [this URL.](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+11.2-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html){ rel=nofollow } ~~Google and DuckDuckGo would not return that URL when searching for, say, `freebsd man netstat`, and instead return outdated manuals on third-party hosting or manuals from other distros, so I've bookmarked that URL in my browser.~~ &lt;update&gt; An HN user [pointed out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21567568){ rel=nofollow } that DDG has a `!man` bang command - it forwards to [manpages.me](https://manpage.me){ rel=nofollow } &lt;/update&gt; The manuals are certainly very detailed and answered most of the questions I had, without needing to search forums like I usually have to for Linux questions.

And lastly, I learned that `awk` is a pretty good language for writing complex scripts while still having a simple DSL for shelling out to processes and chomping their output. It does have some idiosyncrasies though:

- Repeatedly "spawn"ing the same process (`"foo" | getline`) actually reads more lines from the first invocation of the process, until explicitly `close()`d.
- Functions can't have local variables; assigning to local variables instead sets global variables. They need to be specified as parameters of the function and ignored by the caller to be local.
- Iterating over arrays with `for-in` has a random iteration order; use an index loop to be stable.
- Splitting function calls over multiple lines requires `\` terminators at some places but not others.

Regardless, it is a godsend to be able to do string processing and arithmetic in a single program without needing to shell out to `grep` or `bc` or `numfmt` or `printf`.

FreeBSD's manual for `awk` specifically is at [this URL.](https://docs.freebsd.org/info/gawk/gawk.info.Index.html){ rel=nofollow }

My dayjob involves working with Raspberry Pis (running Raspbian). I usually ssh to them over ethernet rather than connect a serial cable or a monitor-and-keyboard to them. However if one were to change its IP address while I'm away, I would be locked out of it until I hooked up a serial cable or monitor-and-keyboard and dumped its new IP address. So I decided to write a script that would repeatedly flash the LED on the Pi in morse code corresponding to its current IP address. It was quite easy to write this script in `awk`, including the part of converting the address components to binary via division. It would've been a tad more complicated in `bash`. You can find the script [here.](https://gist.github.com/Arnavion/32bf76c0ad35318c44041a6d1f1cdb39){ rel=nofollow }

Perl would probably be another good choice to solve these kinds of problems, for both Linux and FreeBSD, but I have no experience with it. Maybe one day...
